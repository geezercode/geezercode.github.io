      <p>Subway Therapy became a popular way to share thoughts with strangers after the 2016 presidential election. People were invited to write their feelings and post them in the 14th Street Station in New York, spreading to other stations over subsequent weeks. This is Note Therapy, created to keep communication alive long after the sticky notes have fallen from the subway tile.</p> 
      <p>Post about anything, however:</p>
      <p>No yelling.<br>
          No screaming.<br> 
          Just notes.<br></p>
